# Multilingual Language Conversion Using BLOOMZ and Mistral

## Project Overview

This project implements a multilingual translator between English and 22 Indian languages leveraging advanced language models BLOOMZ-7B1 and Mistral 7B. It uses LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning to adapt these large language models for high-quality translation with limited compute resources.

The system features:
- Translation support for major Indian languages like Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Assamese, and more.
- LoRA fine-tuning for memory-efficient adaptation of BLOOMZ and Mistral.
- Evaluation using industry-standard BLEU and chrF metrics.
- Flexible prompt engineering specific to model type for best translation performance.
- Modular, production-ready codebase for training, evaluation, and inference.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- NVIDIA GPU with at least 16GB VRAM (recommended 24GB+)
- CUDA toolkit installed

### Python Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers peft datasets accelerate bitsandbytes sacrebleu evaluate pandas numpy
```

Additional optional packages for speed and efficiency:

```bash
pip install flash-attn xformers
```

***

## Usage

### Load and Translate

```python
from multilingual_translator import MultilingualTranslator, TranslationConfig

translator = MultilingualTranslator(TranslationConfig.BLOOMZ_MODEL)
translator.load_model()
translator.setup_lora()

text = "Hello, how are you?"
translation = translator.translate(text, "hi")  # Translate to Hindi
print(translation)
```

### Fine-Tune on Custom Data

```python
train_dataset, eval_dataset = translator.prepare_training_data("your_dataset.csv")
trainer = translator.fine_tune(train_dataset, eval_dataset)
```

***

## Dataset Preparation

You can use your own parallel corpus or public datasets such as:

- AI4Bharat BPCC (Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection)
- FLORES-200 for Indian languages
- Custom CSV files with columns `source_text`, `target_text`, `source_lang`, `target_lang`

Example CSV format:

```
source_text,target_text,source_lang,target_lang
"Hello, how are you?","[translate:नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?]",en,hi
"Thank you very much","[translate:बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद]",en,hi
```

***

## Fine-Tuning Process

The model uses LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning with customizable rank and dropout settings. You can configure training epochs, batch sizes, and learning rates in the configuration file.

The training pipeline includes data tokenization, prompt generation, and training loop handling with checkpointing and evaluation.

***

## Evaluation Metrics

This project evaluates translation quality using:

- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score
- chrF (Character F-score) for detailed morphological evaluation
- ROUGE scores for additional summarization quality
- Length-based metrics for translation fluency assessment

Evaluation results are provided by language with detailed reporting and CSV export support.

***

## Performance Optimization

- Supports 8-bit and 4-bit quantization to reduce GPU memory footprint using BitsAndBytes.
- Optional gradient checkpointing to save memory during training.
- Flash attention and PyTorch 2.0 compilation supported for faster training and inference.
- Multi-GPU support with DeepSpeed for scaling.
